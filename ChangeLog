LinPsk ChangeLog
1.2.5
Now building in build directory.
Switching to qt5.

1.2.2
As I got some usb3 problems when transmitting
- the same macro was executed several times though only clicked once

I introduced a timer that assures a minum click time of one second.
More rapid clicks are ignored.

Introducing explicit mode - switching to receive.
In this state you see the letter "A" ( Abort ) in the rx/tx button and you can abort the transmission.
This might help if the transmission does not stop. ( Probably a bug, but I didn' find the reason. )This avoids killing the program.

In debug mode: showing the properties of the sound device.

Enabling usb2serial converters.

Activate/ deactivate macros

1.2.1

Modified RxWindow to enable horizontal scrollbar correctly.
Enable/disable date/time data in qsowindow.
This fields can be set automatically on saving qso data.

Copy data of rx window to clipboard.

1.2

Modified gui to fit on small screens.
Improved soundcard detection.
Introduced Dok field to qsodata.
Predefined frequency values for use with linlogbook.
Introduced language parameter for use with macros.

1.1

Fixed wrong code for 'LF' in rttymodulator.cpp, Thanks to kf9a
'Home key' mapped to 'cr'
Possibility introduced to send 'CR' 'LF' on enter key. Selectable by setup.
Reintroduced squelch for rtty .

1.0

Reading and writing data from /to soundcard now happens in an extra threads.
Switch from qt3 to qt4. This implies major modifications of gui code.
LinPsk now supports Loging via LinLog
New menu for taking qso data for loging. ( Right mouse click in the active rx window )
MFSK16 is now operational. Thanks to Chen, W7AY, who gave me the essential hints.

0.9 

Switching from portaudio to native alsa support
Modified Afc for BPSK31 decoder
Integrating patches 

0.8.1

Improved RTTY decoder

Setting for slashed 0 now will be saved

Fixed some memory leakages

Removed dependancy on qwindowsstyle.h, so LinPsk now should compile on Slackware without problems.

Some minor bugfixes

0.8.0.4

Experimental RTTY decoder ( rtty2 ).

Now 8 bit wav files in Demo mode will be supported.

In RTTY shifts up to 999 Hz are possible now.

Save QSOData now implemented
Data are saved in ADIF format. You can set the name of this file in General settings. The file will be located in the users home directory.

Command c now copies text from the clipboard into the tx buffer, if the TX window is the active window. 

The proportion between colour spectrum and spectrum can be modified.


Fixes

Hopefully fixed the reported freeze when switching from TX to RX.

Fixed that portaudio changes the output volume when level < 10.

Now squelch changes colour when the level goes above selected squelch level ( like LinPsk does).

Some minor bugs fixed. Now using qt 3.3.2 , which improves the layout of some buttons.
