LinPsk ChangeLog
1.3.7

If cr/lf is received only print one newline.
Each single cr or lf just prints one newline.
Now qt5 is required.

1.3.5
Adding PSK63 mode
Fixing wrong scaling in Spectrum display

1.3.1
Building with qt4 or qt5 depending on qmake.
If qmake detects hamlib, LinPSK will be build with hamlib support.
Now you can define bands and a preferred frequency to use.
On startup the frequency and the tx-power setting is read from the tx and inserted in the qso tab.
Changing the entry in the tab will will change the tx - settings.

You have to setup the communication parameter in the general settings menu.

Removing textfile input for demo mode. Only wav files are supported in the future.
1.2.5
Now building in build directory.
Switching to qt5.

1.2.2
As I got some usb3 problems when transmitting
- the same macro was executed several times though only clicked once

I introduced a timer that assures a minum click time of one second.
More rapid clicks are ignored.

Introducing explicit mode - switching to receive.
In this state you see the letter "A" ( Abort ) in the rx/tx button and you can abort the transmission.
This might help if the transmission does not stop. ( Probably a bug, but I didn' find the reason. )This avoids killing the program.

In debug mode: showing the properties of the sound device.

Enabling usb2serial converters.

Activate/ deactivate macros

1.2.1

Modified RxWindow to enable horizontal scrollbar correctly.
Enable/disable date/time data in qsowindow.
This fields can be set automatically on saving qso data.

Copy data of rx window to clipboard.

1.2

Modified gui to fit on small screens.
Improved soundcard detection.
Introduced Dok field to qsodata.
Predefined frequency values for use with linlogbook.
Introduced language parameter for use with macros.

1.1

Fixed wrong code for 'LF' in rttymodulator.cpp, Thanks to kf9a
'Home key' mapped to 'cr'
Possibility introduced to send 'CR' 'LF' on enter key. Selectable by setup.
Reintroduced squelch for rtty .

1.0

Reading and writing data from /to soundcard now happens in an extra threads.
Switch from qt3 to qt4. This implies major modifications of gui code.
LinPsk now supports Loging via LinLog
New menu for taking qso data for loging. ( Right mouse click in the active rx window )
MFSK16 is now operational. Thanks to Chen, W7AY, who gave me the essential hints.

0.9 

Switching from portaudio to native alsa support
Modified Afc for BPSK31 decoder
Integrating patches 

0.8.1

Improved RTTY decoder

Setting for slashed 0 now will be saved

Fixed some memory leakages

Removed dependancy on qwindowsstyle.h, so LinPsk now should compile on Slackware without problems.

Some minor bugfixes

0.8.0.4

Experimental RTTY decoder ( rtty2 ).

Now 8 bit wav files in Demo mode will be supported.

In RTTY shifts up to 999 Hz are possible now.

RTTY is now able to transmit in LSB. 

USB to Serial Converter for RX/TX switching now really works
  
Hopefully fixed crash on quit

Using UTC in QSOData

0.8.0.3

New features

Supporting USB to Serial Converter for RX/TX switching

( Due to missing hardware untested )

Looks in the /dev directory for devices that contain the string usbserial.

added to General Settings

Delete macro
Rename macro


Save QSOData now implemented
Data are saved in ADIF format. You can set the name of this file in General settings. The file will be located in the users home directory.

Command c now copies text from the clipboard into the tx buffer, if the TX window is the active window. 

The proportion between colour spectrum and spectrum can be modified.


Fixes

Hopefully fixed the reported freeze when switching from TX to RX.

Fixed that portaudio changes the output volume when level < 10.

Now squelch changes colour when the level goes above selected squelch level ( like LinPsk does).

Some minor bugs fixed. Now using qt 3.3.2 , which improves the layout of some buttons.

Switched to fftw 3.0.1

 
0.8.0.2

Characters, that were deleted , won't be transmitted together with the delete anymore.

Fixed bug in setting input and output volume

Windows position now will be saved when exiting the application by Quit.

Trying to fix crash, when closing DarwinPsk by the little red button


0.8.0.1

Fixing the "spinning disc of death"
