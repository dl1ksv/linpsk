Important: This version requires >=qt5.10!!!
You need fftw3.

To build LinPsk, untar the tar archiv or clone the repository
and switch to the linpsk directory.

run:
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake -o Makefile ../linpsk.pro
make
sudo make install

This will install the binary into usr/local/bin, the desktop file into /usr/share/applications and the icon file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ .

LinPSK is build with hamlib support, if qmake finds the hamlib library (by pkg-config).
In this case you can control the Tx power by the qsodata settings, if your rig supports this feature.

Now you can define a list of bands, which is used in the setup of the qso data.
If you select a band and LinPSK was build with hamlib support your rig is tuned to the preferred frequency of this band.

For LinLogbook users:
Band name and Tx power can be used to log with LinLogbook.

For those who prefer to log to a ( adif) file: 
Band name, prefered Frequency and Tx power are written to the file.

As LinPSK uses the alsa sound system, you can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name can be used now. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens

plughw:[cardnumber]

In case of problems you can define ( more complex ) devices in your .asoundrc file. The should be named LinPSK_Record and LinPSK_Play.
