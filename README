Important: This version requires >=qt5.10!!!

To build LinPsk, untar the tar archiv and switch to the linpsk directory.
You need fftw3.
Now you can define a list of bands, which is used in the setup of the qso data.
If you select a band and LinPSK is build with hamlib support your rig is tuned to the preferred frequency of this band.

LinPSK is build with hamlib support, if qmake finds the hamlib library (by pkg-config).
Additionaly you can control the Tx power by the qsodata settings, if your rig supports this feature.

Band name and Tx power can be used to log with LinLogbook.

run:
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake -o Makefile ../linpsk.pro
make
sudo make install

This will install the binary into usr/local/bin and the desktop file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ and the icon file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ .

As LinPSK uses the alsa sound system, you can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name can be used now. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens

plughw:[cardnumber]

In case of problems you can define ( more complex ) devices in your .asoundrc file. The should be named LinPSK_Record and LinPSK_Play.
