To build linpsk, untar the tar archiv and switch to the linpsk directory.

run:
qmake -o Makefile linpsk.pro
make

The executable linpsk is build in the bin subdirectory. Move the binary into prefered location , probably /usr/local/bin

LinPSK now uses the alsa sound system.
The names of the used alsa devices are LinPSK_Record and LinPSK_Play as default.
To map these names to your soundcard edit the file asoundrc in the linpsk directory appropriately and append it to .asoundrc in your homedirectory.
If no .asoundrc exists copy the edited asoundrc to .asoundrc in your homedirectory instead of appending.

Instead of using LinPSK_Record/ LinPSK_Play now you can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name can be used. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens
plughw:[cardnumber]
